<br>I enjoy listening to music. I like all kinds of styles of music, but my favorite is still **pure music**. I also like the feeling of instrumental performances. Therefore, I taught myself to play the **guitar**. Since I was a child, I have loved sports. After school, I always made arrangements with my friends to play **basketball** or **football**. In summer, I would go **swimming**. 

## photography

<br>Some people say you don't know photography, but you must document your life. It doesn't matter if your photos aren't good. Not being able to record something is the most regrettable thing because even after the event, it's impossible to imagine it again. When you press the shutter, time stands still here. The significance of images lies in turning the enjoyable moments into an eternity. When you look back and recall your emotions at that time, it will make this memory more concrete and vivid.
